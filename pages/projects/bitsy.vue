            Set in the small town of Ann Siang Hill, an infamous cold case
            on children going missing led to the abandonment of the ghastly
            neighbourhood. Inspector Tan took the case into his own hands
            for personal reasons, only to struggle between hallucinations
            and reality. The mysterious visions he encounters as he travels
            through the ghost town looking for clues leads him closer towards
            the larger truth behind the disappearances of the children.<br>
            <br>
            Throughout the game, you will discover visions of the past through
            the persona. This is indicated by entering a colorized version of
            the scene. You may also pick up evidences from NPCs or props on
            the ground. These evidences will hint at the places to go, or
            unravel bits of pieces of the storyline. You are encouraged to
            replay a couple of times to get the whole story!
